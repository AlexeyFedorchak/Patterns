# Patterns
Programming patterns examples on PHP. Environment for adding new patterns.

Here we have an environment for adding new patterns. Every pattern has her own directory. The firts idea about this pattern is realized in index.php file. 

You may add new pattern by command:
php make.php PatternName

The new directory with ready index.php file will be created. Also the new line will be added to index.php in root directory to make it possible to check all the patterns in browser window.

Also you may remove patterns:

php del.php PatternName

For using described commands you need to have server.The release with ready server is in developing process, let me finish my current project and back to the patterns...

This repo has been created with big passion to programing and developing new flexible, complex and optimized structures. So, I would be very thankful for any comments
